Today is 20/02/2020

I learned that I failed in my postgraduate entrance examination
It's really frustrating
I thought I could hold back my tears, but I didn't achieve
I failed to live up to my dear parents' expectations
I failed to live up to my tutor
I failed to live up to myself
But at the end of the day, it's me who put pen to paper
It's my mistake
Did I really work hard enough?
Did I really spend enough time?
Did I really stick to my heart all the time?
In such a period of time
Also missed the best choice for studying abroad
After a long deliberation
I decided to take part in the postgraduate entrance examination again at the end of this year
And it's time to start my graduation project
So I started using my account
I will keep a diary everyday to record my mood
It can also improve my english ability
Upload the front-end learning project of the day every day
Before long, I will start to review the examination subjects
I have to work harder
By the way
I guess in the future, I will laugh at my boring diary with full of language defects and bad code
Hahaha
Anyway, cheer up and hurry up
This is today

End.
