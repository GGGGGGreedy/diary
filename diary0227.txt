Today is 27/02/2020

It's been a week since the first diary
This week I wrote a simple static page
It's a resume
Some food has been made this week
Today, I learned chocolate Kesong and bacon stewed rice
I strongly recommend learning to make stewed rice, which is low in oil, low in salt and rich in nutrition
I often lie on the sofa because I can't go out recently
This is not a good position, it will cause shoulder ache
So I found my massage machine
I gave it to mom and dad to pinch their shoulders and beat their backs
Oh, my God. It's really comfortable
Next, I'm going to write a personal homepage and learn JS
I hope I can finish my graduation project well
This is today
